Bing-Feedback-Rochio
====================

This is basically a feedback search engine which uses Bing Search API and returns 10 results after taking a query from the user. The user then marks relevant documents out of the returned documents which are then used to filter a word most relevant to those documents based on Rochio algorithm/I-Dec-Hi. This search engine loops multiple time until a precision marked by the user is reached.
